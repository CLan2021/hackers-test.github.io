## What is this page?
This is an example github page that can be generated when you create a repo called `{username}.github.io`. Go to Settings and enable Github Pages for the repo. If you want you can also set a Theme.

All of the code for this page is simply written in Markdown here in the README file. You can use this repository to create a fully functional static website. This can be extended to create larger sites, like the one for this course [https://eaton-lab.org/hack-the-planet](https://eaton-lab.org/hack-the-planet).


## Check out my code
```python
## my favorite function
def phylo(action):
    if action == "eat":
        print("yum yum yum")
    elif action == "sleep":
        print("zzzzzzz")
    elif action == "walk":
        print("... wizzzzzz... plop")
    else:
        print("sorry, I only eat, sleep, and walk")
```

```python
## test my code
phylo("eat")
```

```python
yum yum yum
```
